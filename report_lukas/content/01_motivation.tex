It is often difficult to accurately identify the species of a flower just by looking at an image of it. 
However, there are a number of visual features, that can help with this task, like the number and form of the petals, different colours of different parts of the flower, etc.
Therefore, it is of interest to see if a neural network can use such characteristic image features to correctly classify the images based on the flower species.
If this classification is sufficiently successful, it will also be interesting to see if the neural network confuses some pairs or groups of flower species more often with one another than others
and if those groups also look similar to the human eye if the neural network might even be better at identifying some flower species than the human eye.
